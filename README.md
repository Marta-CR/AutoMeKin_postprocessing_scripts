**AutoMeKin Output Processing Scripts**

Hi there,

These scripts are designed to help organize and process the outputs generated by AutoMeKin. Once your AutoMeKin decomposition has successfully completed, follow these steps to utilize the provided scripts effectively:

**Step 1: Organize Data Inside the FINAL_HL_(name) Folder**
    1. Run extract_cartesians_mod.py:
        This script extracts Cartesian coordinates of the molecules and organizes them into separate files. It simplifies visualization of your MIN, TS, and PROD molecules.
    2. Run create_tables_mod.py:
        This script generates: 
            FILEinfo_zpecorr documents with corrected energies.
            A PRODinfo file.
            It also creates LaTeX-friendly tables summarizing the energies of your MIN, TS, and PROD molecules for convenient documentation.

These scripts ensure your data is well-organized and ready for further analysis or reporting.

**Step 2: Consolidate Outputs with outputs-extractor_mod.py**
    Return to your main directory and
    1. execute the outputs-extractor_mod.py script.
        This script:
            Creates an OUTPUT folder to centralize all relevant log files produced by AutoMeKin. The log/out files are renamed to match the corresponding entries in the MINinfo, TSinfo, and PRODinfo documents.


**Key Features:**
Overall these scripts aim at simplifying visualization and data organization by separating Cartesian coordinates into independent files.
Provides user-friendly outputs, including ready-to-use LaTeX tables and well-organized log files.

**Additional Notes:**
Ensure the FINAL_HL_(name) folder and tsdirHL directory exist before running the scripts. In case, the user is a bit lost, the scripts will automatically detect these directories and confirm their presence.

Good luck, and happy analyzing! :)
